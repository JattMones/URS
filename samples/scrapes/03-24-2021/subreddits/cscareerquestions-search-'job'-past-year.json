They demanded a CS degree, interviewed me on my dev skills, and gave me the title \u201csoftware developer,\u201d but after I accepted the offer, they told me I would not be doing any dev work.

            "selftext": "I have like documented my entire journey from May 2019, So this may be long to read.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Little Background**\n\n* I graduated from a reputed college in India in Computer Science in May 2019. I hated coding during college and never tried to focus on it. I felt overwhelmed in college due to the competitive environment there.\n* After May 2019, I had no idea what to do after graduation. I never sat for campus placements even though my college had a very nice record. At that time I didn't want to end up in this area.\n* 3 months passed by, I did nothing (I live with my parents) and was just home. Fortunately I had some good friends during college, who suggested me that there's still a chance that I can try to get in the field, If I start fresh, as there's no college pressure now and assured me that I can do it.\n* I was already familiar with python and spent like 2 months (Sept-Oct 2019) doing easy level and then medium level leetcode questions, 1 problem daily. (Focused on only Basic Arrays, strings, linked list and Tree questions).\n* Then my friend suggested me to try Flask, which led me to enroll in a course named Web programming with Python and JS (CS50 WEB) by Harvard University.\n* This course entirely changed my perspective, and was like a direction that lead me deeper in the web development area. I spent (Oct 2019 - Dec 2019) 2-3 months trying to finish this course at my own pace. \n* I already knew HTML and CSS before. Some stuff I learned through this course were Git, basic db stuff, Flask, Basic JS concepts, Django, dom manipulation, and concepts related to scaling, security etc.\n* So with this course, I created like 4 projects from scratch, some using Flask, and some using django. And I hosted this apps on Heroku. And then started applying for jobs(Jan 2020 - )\n* So initially I felt overwhelmed while applying, as I never interviewed before. But eventually coped up with it and kept applying and interviewing. I got very less interviews.\n\n**COVID period** \n\n* Then COVID came around March 2020 first week and it added to my already demotivated journey of job hunting.\n* During that time I learned Angular. And tried to revamp my previous projects (which were just static sites) with angular and I integrated them. During this time I learnt many new things about JS, I deeply learnt about how Web works, how Internet works, Networking concepts, HTTP, REST, OOPs and all the basic stuff.\n* So I had a pretty good idea about what kind of questions I should expect from an interview and I would prepare accordingly.\n* Around August 2020 last week, one of a no name angel list startup offered me an internship role for 2 months with a joke of stipend. As I was desperate and had no prior internship, I accepted this opportunity and spend two months remotely doing this internship.\n\n**Internship (Sept - Nov 2020)**\n\n* Even though there were like literally 5-6 people in the company, and I knew that I'm just a cheap labor in name of an intern, I tried to make most out of it, and learned many new things there as well. I had no regrets.\n* They even offered me Full time role, again with joke of a salary. But this time I declined, as there was no proper structure, no testing, nothing. And I had a feeling that I would now get a new job quickly but it wasn't like so.\n\n**After Internship (Nov 2020 - March 2021)**\n\n* So again I started applying. Usually I'd try to apply like 20 companies on a single day. Or some weeks I'd apply daily to like 4-5 companies.\n* From when I started tracking (from July 2020) of which companies I've applied to in Google sheets file, I've applied to around 250+ companies. I know that's a huge number of companies. It has come down to how good your resume is, and whether your cover letter is good enough.\n* Mostly from these applications I had potentially like 15 companies where I had gone through at least one round of hiring process seriously.\n* I had many phone screens as well, where sometimes the company didn't considered me a good fit, while other times it was vice versa.\n* And also I've been ghosted by many after interviews.\n* During this period, I have encountered mostly take-home tasks and very few leet code style screenings.\n* I would only do the take-homes If I feel that I'm not being used as a free labor. Also I had learnt about Nodejs during intern, So I would try to learn new stuff, and also try to create new projects. But mostly I would try to revamp or improve my existing ones.\n\n**Breakthrough**\n\n* So I came across the company (which is a well known startup in India) from which I got the offer. I came to know about this company in Feb 2021 when I saw a tweet from someone on my TL related to the company. So I went on their website and applied from there.\n* So I had like 4 rounds with them which lasted for almost a month\n   * Basic Technical Discussion\n   * Take home task -> Code Review + A Live task was given, to make an improvement in the code that I submitted.\n   * Another technical round (DS, Algorithms and System design questions)\n   * Final round with CTO (technical discussion type, cultural fit check)\n* I knew that all of my rounds went well and I had cleared all the rounds as HR informed me that they have positive feedback.\n* I usually try to avoid initiating salary discussion from my end and try my best to not give a number from my side, during initial phases.\n* After all rounds were over they then asked me about the expected CTC. So I was prepared for that, I had already researched on glassdoor like what the company provides to same role in the same location. Now I had this range with me which I needed to mention when asked.\n* So I quoted for a salary range that I never would have even thought about an year before. I was undervaluing myself very much to like almost half of what I quoted.\n* They accepted my quoted range and offer me the lower bound one. I wanted to play safe as I had no other offers, but even though I tried asking if there's any room for increment. HR said they might need to discuss internally. When they shared the letter, it was more than what they initially offered and I was happy with that.\n\n**Some thoughts/ Approaches that I followed**\n\n* I am from India, so there might be some different approaches in reaching out to companies as this sub is mostly US based. Mostly I've applied through Indeed, Linked In, sometimes through angel list and through any leads I could get. I even try to get list of some good companies and would literally apply on their career section. Obviously I didn't aim for any FAANG. I just wanted to enter in the industry with average salary (that doesn't mean you aim low).\n* Although this approach has very less success. One advice I got was to get referrals from your network. But I didn't try getting referrals as I was kind of shy in asking (big mistake and setback for me). \n* I prepared a Google keep, where I stored all the links to blogs, concepts, articles which I could refer to before interview. My intern role was more frontend based, but I tried to learn backend as well and would apply for Full Stack roles. So this was kind of slow down factor, and I believed that I should have just focused on one of them. \n* Before an interview, I say this to myself that it's nothing but a discussion, and no one is gonna judge me.\n* Most difficult thing when an interview begins is to answer the question \"Tell Me about yourself?\". Your answer to this question would be like a foundation for how your rest of the interview is gonna be.\n   *  And I know when you have a gap and no prior experience, it kind of becomes awkward answering that.\n   * I would begin describing my graduation year and major.\n   * What I did after college, how would I utilize my time, which technologies I learnt.\n   * What's the most recent experience I had, If any.\n* I knew that I have drastically improved my communication skills over this period. And I added that to my advantage.\n* I would always try to be humble when interviewing, and would always speak softly. If I didn't know about something, I would simply say that I'm not aware about that and might have to look. Or I would politely ask them If they could tell me the answer (depends on situation).\n* Reverse interview questions are important and you definitely need to ask interviewer questions at the end, to standout from others. Questions should be interesting and should be framed in a way that can make the interviewer more attentive towards you.\n* After every interview,  I would note about which things I wasn't able to answer in a doc file, so I wouldn't miss that next time.\n* There were times were I felt burn out and demotivated. So it's okay to take a break and one should know when to take them.\n* I have been an active member on this subreddit since I started job searching, also I followed some cool people on tech twitter, which were helpful in some way or other.\n* At last, I'm satisfied with what I have presently, and the wait and journey was worth it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n\n* Began my job hunting journey from scratch after my graduation in CS.\n* No prior Internships.\n* Built projects during the time.\n* Landed an internship in a small startup. They offered full time, but I declined.\n* Started job search again.\n* 250+ applications.\n* Got an offer I never would have imagined one year before.\n\n**PS**\n\n\n* This post was meant for motivating others who are on the same boat. If someone like me could do this, you definitely can.\n* I won't mention the company name or my college name as I prefer to be anonymous on reddit.\n*  I don't want to directly reveal the CTC as well but for those people who are asking me, its closer to the lower bound of 10-15 LPA range",

But for the first 6 months, they want me to write SQL to get data out of database for reporting\u2026so just SELECT statements, for 6 months\u2026\n\nI am surprised they could look at my CV and my skill set and map me to writing just SQL reports for 6 months, but if I don\u2019t start the job, I will be unemployed.\n\nAnd if they do actually start the project rewrite in 6 months\u2019 time, it could be quite interesting. They are offering a good Salary for my country and have a good reputation as a company.\n\nAny advice would be really appreciated. I haven\u2019t started the new job yet but I\u2019ve signed the contract. I wouldn\u2019t go back to my old company as I burned out there and think my desperation to leave has put me in this situation.\n\nI can\u2019t even begin to describe how stupid I feel.\n\nMy advice to anyone reading this, think really carefully about resigning from your current job if you don\u2019t know exactly what the project and tech you\u2019ll be using will be (unless you really just want to work for that company no matter what).",

(over 1 year of experience)\n\nAfter Graduating in December 2019.\n\n* Continued teaching kids how to code.\n* Applied to around 20 - 50 different companies.\n* Only a few ever responded.\n* 1 Job Interview after graduation (The company that hired me).\n\nMy Resume: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tckrTpAlxdlsfRoiwOYO\\_E9CasdnqtTu/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tckrTpAlxdlsfRoiwOYO_E9CasdnqtTu/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**What I learned:**\n\n* After you graduate practice every day the concepts you learned in College.  DataStructures, Software Engineering Principles, Operating Systems, Linux, Web Programming, Git, Software Architecture ect.. That way you can answer any question the interviewer throws your way.  Become a master of these concepts.\n* Beyond that, Learn concepts that they didn't cover much in schools such as dynamic programming, Jira, AWS, Jenkins, test software, developer tools, and more.  (From my perspective we didn't learn much about this).\n* HUGE TIP: Simulate work experience as best as you can by Join an open-source project on GitHub.  I did some work on [https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python).  A project that tries to implement all algorithms in python.  I learned how to test code doing this and got more practice using git.\n* Do not make a fancy resume with your photo, columns, tables ect.. I did this and didn't get a reply for like 8 months, found out that Applicant Tracking Software can't read those too well so it is better to write a plane resume that is readable line by line.\n* Test your resume on one of these websites that give it ATS score.  My fancy resume got a score of 16% but once I changed it to look more plane and changed the wording I got a score of 46% then I started getting a lot more replies from companies. I used [https://resumeworded.com/resume-scanner](https://resumeworded.com/resume-scanner)\n* Solve one LeetCode question a day, create 4 solid advanced programming projects, and put them on GitHub and on your resume.  Make your LinkedIn stellar.\n* Study your ass off when you have an upcoming interview.\n* During the interview, speak loudly, ask a lot of questions, build off questions from the ones they ask you.  This makes it sounds like you know what you are talking about, that you are interested, and have some form of control during the interview.  Also be nice and grateful.\n\nFor those of you who get super nervous during interviews believe me, so do I.  I was so nervous before my interviews that my stomach physically hurt every day.  I would have diarrhea, and couldn't think of anything else besides the nervousness I felt.  The only thing that helped slightly was preparing to feel more confident, taking deep breaths, and going for walks.\n\nLastly, I am not a genius that went to a good university.  My GPA was average.  Yes, I was desperate, I thought I would never make it, worried about my future, stressed all the time, felt behind, but I still worked my ass off every day, kept applying, and never gave up.  I even demonstrated the hard work I put in during my interview to show them I care.\n\nI also believe some luck and opportunity is involved during this process but there's not much you can do about that so just focus on the hard work.\n\nKeep your head high and good luck on getting your foot in the door. :)\n\nAlso, I'm from San Diego, CA",

After that keep applying for jobs, working on personal projects, practicing behavior questions, and leetcode. We will get through this together!\n\nIf you need someone to talk to, please leave a comment here.

There was a fake interview process where they had him answer some behavioral type questions. There was no face to face meetings in person or over zoom. There was no technical interview. As part of the job he was going to get paid a good rate for \"training\" then would get his full rate a few days after that.\n\nThe scam came when he was told that he was going to be sent a company check that he could then use to pay for his company issued macbook and software. Never do this. Thankfully he felt like something was up and started asking people he knew before doing anything else.\n\nHe did send out his address, email and phone number. Hopefully this information won't be too bad...\n\nSome of the red flags to look for:\n1. a non cooperate email address (@gmail, @outlook, etc)\n2. urgency to finish everything quickly (Have you signed it yet?!)\n3.

Just because someone has bad English does not make it a scam, but be alert if things feel off or appear along with other red flags. If you feel funny about a job, its better to be safe about it.\n\nNever send money to anyone you don't know.",

            "selftext": "My mom\u2019s company let go all of the older software engineers who were working from home last July. My mom had worked there for over 20 years. Their reasoning was that they wanted people to work in-person at their new office headquarters across the country. But probably the real reason was to replace the higher income people with new grads who will work at a lower salary.\n\nShe\u2019s been applying for as many jobs as possible this whole time, even low salary jobs that aren\u2019t programming related. She\u2019s also been taking online training courses  in C# I think and maybe some others. She hasn\u2019t been able to find a new programming job or even a secretary type position somewhere.\n\nDoes anyone have advice for a programmer experienced in XSLT, PL1, or JCL? They only gave her 4 months severance and things are getting kind of hard. My mom would prefer another work from home position but is willing to work somewhere within a 4 hour drive from Indianapolis, Indiana. Thank you for any help you can give :)\n\nEdit: thank you guys so much! I expected to get a few replies at most and I\u2019m shocked at how kind and helpful this sub is. I told my mom about a lot of your comments and it made her happy. I told her I saw a few comments saying that she must be pretty smart to know XSLT so well, which made her feel good.\n\nMy mom\u2019s still in touch with her former coworkers who were also laid off - they have a video call every couple weeks or so. As far as I know, no one else has found a job yet either, however I don\u2019t know how hard the others are looking. My mom always says those meetings are so depressing because her old coworkers just complain a bunch.\n\nShe\u2019s on LinkedIn and it\u2019s updated. She gets calls and messages from recruiters all the time honestly, but the jobs they suggest for her are usually looking for different languages. So if she gets an interview, it doesn\u2019t usually go very well. \n\nI\u2019m not offended by comments saying she should\u2019ve kept her skills more current. I agree. And I appreciate other comments reminding people that she\u2019s from a different generation where people could count on working for one company for their whole career. I graduated from engineering school a few years ago and we had a required seminar class where industry people would come speak and basically tell us how important it is to continue educating yourself throughout your career. I\u2019m sure my mom didn\u2019t have that benefit. And, yes she did have to take stacks of code cards down to the single big basement computer at Indiana University. I think she graduated in the late 80\u2019s, possibly very early 90\u2019s. She didn\u2019t go to college until her late 20\u2019s though, so she\u2019s in her early 60\u2019s now. She might prefer to work longer, but she really just needs a job for like 5 years so she can get the higher retirement amount.\n\nAnyway thank you all so much!! I\u2019ll post this to r/mainframe and r/experienceddevs as well.\n\nEdit 2: forgot to say that she is on unemployment right now, but it\u2019s nowhere near enough for her bills. My siblings and I are helping out as much as we can, but it\u2019s still not sustainable. Plus she\u2019s kind of a workaholic (requirement for programmers?) and is going crazy lol.\n\nEdit 3: the reason I posted this is because I could tell my mom has started to get really discouraged. It seems like she\u2019s only looking for secretary type jobs lately and doesn\u2019t talk much about software jobs anymore. After so many rejections, I can understand. But I want her to be able to do what she loves and it just seems like there has to be a market for her skills somewhere. I took screenshots of some of the comments here, especially the people saying that she must be pretty smart to have worked on XSLT. I showed them to her and she was so happy. She said it was what she needed to be re-inspired to look for programming jobs. So again, thank you all so much for your kindness!",

            "selftext": "Hey, long time lurker here, can find my background in this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jaevpq/switching\\_to\\_swe\\_am\\_i\\_ready/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jaevpq/switching_to_swe_am_i_ready/). I posted this about 4 months ago when I was ready to take LeetCode seriously and try to better understand the interview. I recently received an offer at FAANG for an entry level software engineering role and would love to share my experiences in regards to the process.\n\nI've seen a lot of posts on here overly negative about the interview process, and I'd agree that the process is really grueling, but I do think there's productive ways on iterating through the coding interview. I've seen people talk about how much they've worked (8-10 hour days for multiple months on end), and honestly, **I think that's really big overkill/probably not the best use of your time.** Preparation for these interviews felt mostly on understanding big picture, not about grinding every minute detail of particular coding problems. (i.e., I probably would not worry too much about topological sort when dealing with graph problems in LeetCode).\n\nPrior to that post, I didn't know 90% of data structures, mostly just dealing with hashmaps and arrays. And to be honest, self teaching this type of material is pretty unintuitive; while I knew how to code because I'd self taught some of it postgrad, without schooling, I lacked hard CS fundamentals. I had to learn a lot of the basic concepts from scratch (recursion i.e., was something I didn't get to even learn until a few months in). Two Sum would literally take me over an hour to complete when I first started.\n\nIn these last 4 months of prepping, I studied about 10-15 hours a week (reading CTCI and doing LeetCode, and AlgoExpert) on average tried to keep my life balance still enjoyable. I think it's incredibly hard to learn well when one is always stressed with the coding interview and recruiting process, so find what works. **I really don't think grinding more hours means a more effective use of your time, and planning out my study sessions as to what I was going to accomplish helped a lot more than just dedicating a ton of time.**\n\nThat aside though, the single most important thing that helped me get up to speed with LeetCode and coding in general was **having people around me.** This might be a strange tip, but you don't really quite know what you don't know/can tunnel very easily when learning LeetCode/CTCI. My group of friends I play video games with are predominantly software engineers, and what was most helpful by far was just having people to bounce ideas off of when doing a problem. **It's much easier to become good at LeetCode if when you practice, you're able to simulate pair programming/how an interview would actually go. For this, it's best to have people around you to talk you through how you're thinking. Doing practice interviews with people will be infinitely more helpful than you pressing run and getting a syntax error on LeetCode.**\n\nThis is where I think LeetCode can be a lot of luck. I don't think I'm talented at interviewing at all, easy LeetCode problems used to take me literally 2 hours of frustration. **However, having a mentor or someone just willing to point out where I could improve my code made me improve much more quickly than if I were to just bang my head against the wall and grind questions. Above all else, I think this is the most \"lucky\" part of the interview, but also makes it much easier to improve.**\n\nI completed about a total of 200 LeetCode problems over a 4 month period, doing maybe a few a day until I was able to become much faster. I can't stress how important it is that when you're doing the problems, for you to learn how to talk through your code while you practice. **In most my interview experiences, I did not finish all the problems given, but rather focused on making sure what I did have on paper was both clear and well-communicated. There's a misconception that you have to be very, very good at those problems; you have to be very, very good at explaining your thoughts in code, not necessarily learning every particular algorithm.**\n\nFor recruiting? Just cold email people. Express interest, build a narrative for yourself. You'll be surprised how many people are willing to give you a chance if you aren't just a name on a resume. I didn't apply to a bunch of places, but I found that most my successes to companies I wouldn't have been qualified on paper for came through me emailing people and talking about my situation. **People drastically underestimate how important it is to have a story to stand out; yes, coding expertise is important, but people really just want to find other people that will be good at the job and fun to work with.**\n\nAlso, just have fun with it. A lot of interviewing is luck, whether you get a good interviewer, a good interview question, whether you pass the resume screen. The process is stressful, you got this. Take all the time you need lol, this process just takes time after all. **I'm really happy I was able to find a job this quickly in the midst of COVID, but honestly, a lot of it was luck. Luck in having people around me to help me learn and iterate on the interview process, luck in passing, etc. Don't be too results oriented, and don't just grind endlessly without purpose. 100-150 really well done and practiced LeetCode problems are way better than 500 endlessly grinded ones. I've maybe done <5 hard questions.**\n\nAnyway my formatting probably sucks",

            "selftext": "Title sums up the post. This is basically an update to [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kpr2iu/spent_2_years_unemployed_after_graduation_finally/) I made on this board in early January about a job offer I signed in late December. TL;DR on that post just for context: I work for the U.S. branch of a European company whose flagship product is written in an old language called Smalltalk... sort of (I'll explain later). In my first post, I expressed my concern that working for this company might be bad for my career due to the relative obscurity of Smalltalk in the SWE job market, and I got lots of great answers from all sorts of perspectives. Of course, I ultimately decided to take the job, since I had no other prospects other than remaining unemployed.\n\nI've now been working for around 2 months, and I'm starting to realize that there's a lot of things I **really** don't like about this job, and it seems like every day I find something new to dislike about it.\n\n**First**, the language. See, it turns out that while I was told I'd be using Smalltalk on the job, the way it actually works is that the company actually uses a *proprietary framework* that is coded in Smalltalk. Basically, my first month on the job included some basic Smalltalk training, along with training in how to use the company's flagship product, and everything from then on involves using the proprietary framework.\n\nThis comes with all the negatives people on this board usually cite when talking about proprietary frameworks:\n\n\\- **Lack of Documentation.** This one explains itself. According to my team's lead developer, the company's philosophy is to \"document\" their code by using \"descriptive names\" for their methods and variables. This isn't done well. Methods are obscure and convoluted, not at all self explanatory, company-specific terminology and jargon is rampant, and the most common way to understand what a method does is to look at how other devs have used it and just copy them.\n\n\\- **Can't Google anything.** Because the framework is proprietary, it's closed-source and therefore no one on Google (or, for that matter, outside of the company) will know anything about the software. So if and when you get stuck, your only recourse is to ask a more senior developer, and if they don't know what to do, then they ask **their** seniors, and so on all the way up to a pair of allegedly-genius-tier \"gurus\" at the European branch who wrote the framework and have been with the company for decades.\n\n\\- **Non-transferrable experience.** If and when you want to leave this company, it's basically impossible to market your skills and experience, because all you know how to do is maintain and expand the company's framework. To this day, the only transferrable skill I've learned at this company is how to use a debugger, and maybe the basics of Smalltalk, assuming I ever run into another company who uses this language again.\n\n**Second**, my pay. I don't believe I mentioned this in my old post, but my TC at this company is $60k. I live in Miami, FL, which is a high COL area. At first, I was happy just to have found a job, but now that I'm actually getting paid I can't help but notice how little I'm making for my area. Rent here is $1.7k+ for a **studio** (not even a full apartment) in any halfway decent area. Once you factor in bills, gas, groceries, student loan payments, and other necessities, I'm basically living paycheck to paycheck. I'm **not** a big spender by any means. At most I'll treat myself to dinner at a Cheesecake Factory on a Friday afternoon or something, but with the money I'm making now I have to think twice about doing even that, and I often end up just forgoing it altogether so I can continue to build up my meager emergency fund.\n\n**Third**, the company culture. At least I think that's what this is called. There are huge numbers of meetings, plus \"team activities\" like playing Pictionary together or \"hanging out\" after work, the kind of \"team-building\" stuff that isn't technically mandatory, but if you refuse you'll be viewed as not being a \"team player\" or whatever and probably end up getting replaced at some point. Also, I'm not really sure how to word this, but at this company, developers are expected to debug code in front of representatives of client companies (!!!). I've never heard of this practice before and have no idea how common it is, but this is an extremely stressful prospect for someone like me with performance anxiety. I had a hard enough time doing whiteboard problems with a job offer on the line... imagine trying to fix a bug with production code in real time in front of some corporate representative, with *my livelihood* (i.e. survival) potentially on the line. I've heard from more senior developers at this company that this is actually really stressful, as many of the client company representatives are very impatient and demanding. I'm trying to drag out my training period for as long as possible to put off having to do this because I just don't know how I'm going to manage it.\n\nI just feel like such an idiot. I slaved away in college, graduated with a 3.83 GPA, all just to end up living a life where I basically can't afford to treat myself to any kind of leisure or fun on my time off. My day is basically I'm really depressed and unhappy, and it's only getting worse every day. I don't know what to do. I feel so exhausted, drained and demotivated after a work day that I don't even want to look at an IDE, let alone grind Leetcode or build portfolio projects like I did before I got this job.\n\nI want to try to apply to other jobs, but I don't know how to go about it in my situation.\n\n1. Should I update my CV and include my current job, even though I've only been there for two months and I haven't really done anything but \"training\"?\n2. Do I have to stay here for some number of months before leaving so that it won't look bad on my CV? If so, how long do I have to stay?\n3. How necessary is Leetcode? Do I have to grind it to make a good enough salary that I can afford some leisure activities without living paycheck to paycheck? I just don't think I have it in me to do this anymore.\n4. What's the best strategy for an entry level developer to look for a full-time remote position? Should I be trying to connect with random recruiters on LinkedIn? Spamming applications like I did before I got this job? I'd like a job in something mainstream like JavaScript/React or Java or something where the experience I accrue on the job will actually open doors without me having to grind Leetcode forever.\n\nSorry if this post is all over the place. I'm very tired and kind of in a daze at the moment. Sunday depression is setting in. I'm literally staring at my clock, begging it to go slower so it won't be Monday again.",

When they interviewed me I told them the truth about how much experience I have and they hired me anyways. So I started at the company and school did close to nothing to prepare me for a real job but my DevOps team kind of just expected me to know all the practice norms immediately and did very little to explain how things work at the company. \n\nMy team is only one other engineer above me and then my manager. Both have this kind of elitist mentality where it is very hard to approach them for help because of answers/attitude like \u201chow do you not know this already\u201d. And funny thing is one of the things on my PIP is not asking enough questions... yeah okay anytime I ask questions they make me feel like shit. I\u2019ve told my manager this too but I guess they still have to have that on the pip list.\n\nSo basically the main reason for my PIP is because I messed up on a deploy a month ago. Someone reverted their PR and I didn\u2019t catch that and merged the empty PR and ran the post deploy command. The next day I was waiting for our team to meet at our usual time and nobody said anything about meeting  so 15 minutes after our meet time I hopped in the shower for 10 minutes. I get out the shower and my computer is being blown up by them about the bad deploy I did and I explain we didn\u2019t meet at our usual time so I took a quick shower. Of course this showed up on my PIP too that I was \u201cunavailable during work hours\u201d.\n\nI really just feel like they do not like me and treat me like shit. They have 8-11 years of experience on me and I feel like they expect way too much from me despite me learning a lot these past 5 months and putting in lots of work (most days I don\u2019t even take a break). \n\nMy manager said if I don\u2019t improve he will have to let me go which I feel like is what he wants but he said he doesn\u2019t want that. I\u2019m becoming depressed more everyday. I\u2019ve never had people make me feel so stupid when I can\u2019t figure something out. I\u2019m honestly pretty close to quitting but worried how it will look when I look for another job. I really hope the CS field is a lot better than this. I really enjoyed it in school but my first job has just been so unpleasant it\u2019s taking away all my passion. \n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the guy whose position I replaced had quit for what seems like similar reasons to me. I heard from others he got really toxic and started to hate the job so he just up and left. I have a feeling he is experiencing what I am going through right now with the team I\u2019m on. \n\nWhat should I do in this scenario? I hope I\u2019m not the bad engineer in this situation but they sure do make me feel incompetent",

            "selftext": "EDIT: I\u2019m on discord to answer your questions: \nhttps://discord.gg/raQ5NjHy\n\nIt\u2019s pretty late in the UK (11.30pm, but I\u2019ll stay up as long as you guys want me to)\n\nOrganisation is Key\n\nI\u2019ve interviewed at Google (and DeepMind), Uber, Facebook, Amazon for roles that lie under the \u201cData Scientist\u201d umbrella and this is the typical interview construction theme I\u2019ve observed:\n\nSoftware Engineering\nApplied Statistics\nMachine Learning\nData Wrangling, Manipulation and Visualisation\n\nNow nobody is expecting some super graduate level competency in all of these topics, but you need to know enough to convince your interviewer that you\u2019re capable of delivering if they offered you the job. How much you need to know depends on the job spec, but in this increasingly competitive market, no knowledge is lost.\n\nI recommend using Notion to organise your job prep. It\u2019s extremely versatile, and enables you to utilise the Spaced Repetition and Active Recall principles to nail down learning and deploying key topics that come up time and time again in a Data Scientist interview. Ali Abdaal has a great tutorial on note taking with Notion to maximise your learning potential during the interview process.\n\nI used to run through my Notion notes over and over, but in particular, right before my interview. This ensured that key topics and definitions were loaded into my working memory and I didn\u2019t waste precious \ntime \u201cummmmmm\u201ding when hit with some question.\n\n2. Software Engineering\nNot all Data Scientist roles will grill you on the time complexity of an algorithm, but all of these roles will expect you to write code. Data Science isn\u2019t one job, but a collection of jobs that attracts talent from a variety of industries, including the software engineering world. As such you\u2019re competing with guys that know the ins and outs of writing efficient code and I would recommend spending at least 1\u20132 hours a day in the lead-up to your interview practicing the following concepts:\n\nArrays\nHash Tables\nLinked Lists\nTwo-Pointer based algorithms\nString algorithms (interviewers LOVE these)\nBinary Search\nDivide and Conquer Algorithms\nSorting Algorithms\nDynamic Programming\nRecursion\n\nDO NOT LEARN THE ALGORITHMS OFF BY HEART. This approach is useless, because the interviewer can question you on any variation of the algorithm and you will be lost. Instead learn the strategy behind how each algorithm works. Learn what computational and spatial complexity are, and learn why they are so fundamental to building efficient code.\n\nLeetCode was my best friend during interview preparation and is well worth the $35 per month in my opinion. Your interviewers only have so many algorithm questions to sample from, and this website covers a host of algorithm concepts including companies that are likely or are known to have asked these questions in the past. There\u2019s also a great community who discuss each problem in detail, and helped me during the myriad of \u201cstuck\u201d moments I encountered. LeetCode has a \u201clite\u201d version with a smaller question bank if the $35 price tag is too steep, as do HackerRank and geeksforgeeks which are other great resources.\n\nWhat you should do is attempt each question, even if it\u2019s a brute force approach that takes ages to run. Then look at the model solution, and try to figure out what the optimal strategy is. Then read up what the optimal strategy is and try to understand why this is the optimal strategy. Ask yourself questions like \u201cwhy is Quicksort O(n\u00b2) average time complexity?\u201d, why do two pointers and one for loop make more sense than three for loops?\n\n3. Applied Statistics\nData science has an implicit dependence on applied statistics, and how implicit that will be depends on the role you\u2019ve applied for. Where do we use applied statistics? It pops up just about anywhere where we need to organise, interpret and derive insights from data.\n\nI studied the following topics intensely during my interviews, and you bet your bottom dollar that I was grilled about each topic:\n\nDescriptive statistics (What distribution does my data follow, what are the modes of the distribution, the expectation, the variance)\nProbability theory (Given my data follows a Binomial distribution, what is the probability of observing 5 paying customers in 10 click-through events)\n\nHypothesis testing (forming the basis of any question on A/B testing, T-tests, anova, chi-squared tests, etc).\n\nRegression (Is the relationship between my variables linear, what are potential sources of bias, what are the assumptions behind the ordinary least squares solution)\n\nBayesian Inference (What are some advantages/disadvantages vs frequentist methods)\n\nIf you think this is a lot of material you are not alone, I was massively overwhelmed with the volume of knowledge expected in these kinds of interviews and the plethora of information on the internet that could help me. Two invaluable resources come to mind when I was revising for interviews.\n\nIntroduction to Probability and Statistics, an open course on everything listed above including questions and an exam to help you test your knowledge.\n\nMachine Learning: A Bayesian and Optimization Perspective by Sergios Theodoridis. This is more a machine learning text than a specific primer on applied statistics, but the linear algebra approaches outlined here really help drive home the key statistical concepts on regression.\n\nThe way you\u2019re going to remember this stuff isn\u2019t through memorisation, you need to solve as many problems as you can get your hands on. Glassdoor is a great repo for the sorts of applied stats questions typically asked in interviews. The most challenging interview I had by far was with G-Research, but I really enjoyed studying for the exam, and their sample exam papers were fantastic resources when it came to testing how far I was getting in my applied statistics revision.\n\n4. Machine Learning\nNow we come to the beast, the buzzword of our millennial era, and a topic so broad that it can be easy to get so lost in revision that you want to give up.\nThe applied statistics part of this study guide will give you a very very strong foundation to get started with machine learning (which is basically just applied applied statistics written in fancy linear algebra), but there are certain key concepts that came up over and over again during my interviews. Here is a (by no means exhaustive) set of concepts organised by topic:\n\nMetrics \u2014 Classification\nConfusion Matrices, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Sensitivity\nF1 Score\nTPR, TNR, FPR, FNR\nType I and Type II errors\nAUC-ROC Curves\n\nMetrics \u2014 Regression\nTotal sum of squares, explained sum of squares, residual sum of squares\nCoefficient of determination and its adjusted form\nAIC and BIC\nAdvantages and disadvantages of RMSE, MSE, MAE, MAPE\n\nBias-Variance Tradeoff, Over/Under-Fitting\nK Nearest Neighbours algorithm and the choice of k in bias-variance trade-off\nRandom Forests\nThe asymptotic property\nCurse of dimensionality\nModel Selection\nK-Fold Cross Validation\nL1 and L2 Regularisation\nBayesian Optimization\n\nSampling\nDealing with class imbalance when training classification models\nSMOTE for generating pseudo observations for an underrepresented class\nClass imbalance in the independent variables\nSampling methods\nSources of sampling bias\nMeasuring Sampling Error\n\nHypothesis Testing\nThis really comes under under applied statistics, but I cannot stress enough the importance of learning about statistical power. It\u2019s enormously important in A/B testing.\n\nRegression Models\nOrdinary Linear Regression, its assumptions, estimator derivation and limitations are covered in significant detail in the sources cited in the applied statistics section. Other regression models you should be familiar with are:\nDeep Neural Networks for Regression\nRandom Forest Regression\nXGBoost Regression\nTime Series Regression (ARIMA/SARIMA)\nBayesian Linear Regression\nGaussian Process Regression\n\nClustering Algorithms\nK-Means\nHierarchical Clustering\nDirichlet Process Mixture Models\n\nClassification Models\nLogistic Regression (Most important one, revise well)\nMultiple Regression\nXGBoost Classification\nSupport Vector Machines\n\nIt\u2019s a lot, but much of the content will be trivial if your applied statistics foundation is strong enough. I would recommend knowing the ins and outs of at least three different classification/regression/clustering methods, because the interviewer could always (and has previously) asked \u201cwhat other methods could we have used, what are some advantages/disadvantages\u201d? This is a small subset of the machine learning knowledge in the world, but if you know these important examples, the interviews will flow a lot more smoothly.\n\n5. Data Manipulation and Visualisation\n\u201cWhat are some of the steps for data wrangling and data cleaning before applying machine learning algorithms\u201d?\n\nWe are given a new dataset, the first thing you\u2019ll need to prove is that you can perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA). Before you learn anything realise that there is one path to success in data wrangling: Pandas. The Pandas IDE, when used correctly, is the most powerful tool in a data scientists toolbox. The best way to learn how to use Pandas for data manipulation is to download many, many datasets and learn how to do the following set of tasks as confidently as you making your morning cup of coffee.\n\nOne of my interviews involved downloading a dataset, cleaning it, visualising it, performing feature selection, building and evaluating a model all in one hour. It was a crazy hard task, and I felt overwhelmed at times, but I made sure I had practiced building model pipelines for weeks before actually attempting the interview, so I knew I could find my way if I got lost.\n\nAdvice: The only way to get good at all this is to practice, and the Kaggle community has an incredible wealth of knowledge on mastering EDAs and model pipeline building. I would check out some of the top ranking notebooks on some of the projects out there. Download some example datasets and build your own notebooks, get familiar with the Pandas syntax.\n\nData Organisation\nThere are three sure things in life: death, taxes and getting asked to merge datasets, and perform groupby and apply tasks on said merged datasets. Pandas is INCREDIBLY versatile at this, so please practice practice practice.\n\nData Profiling\nThis involves getting a feel for the \u201cmeta\u201d characteristics of the dataset, such as the shape and description of numerical, categorical and date-time features in the data. You should always be seeking to address a set of questions like \u201chow many observations do I have\u201d, \u201cwhat does the distribution of each feature look like\u201d, \u201cwhat do the features mean\u201d. This kind of profiling early on can help you reject non-relevant features from the outset, such as categorical features with thousands of levels (names, unique identifiers) and mean less work for you and your machine later on (work smart, not hard, or something woke like that).\n\nData Visualisation\nHere you are asking yourself \u201cwhat does the distribution of my features even look like?\u201d. A word of advice, if you didn\u2019t learn about boxplots in the applied statistics part of the study guide, then here is where I stress you learn about them, because you need to learn how to identify outliers visually and we can discuss how to deal with them later on. Histograms and kernel density estimation plots are extremely useful tools when looking at properties of the distributions of each feature.\nWe can then ask \u201cwhat does the relationship between my features look like\u201d, in which case Python has a package called seaborn containing very nifty tools like pairplot and a visually satisfying heatmap for correlation plots.\nHandling Null Values, Syntax Errors and Duplicate Rows/Columns\nMissing values are a sure thing in any dataset, and arise due to a multitude of different factors, each contributing to bias in their own unique way. There is a whole field of study on how best to deal with missing values (and I once had an interview where I was expected to know individual methods for missing value imputation in much detail). Check out this primer on ways of handling null values.\n\nSyntax errors typically arise when our dataset contains information that has been manually input, such as through a form. This could lead us to erroneously conclude that a categorical feature has many more levels than are actually present, because \u201cHot\u201d, \u2018hOt\u201d, \u201chot/n\u201d are all considered unique levels. Check out this primer on handling dirty text data.\nFinally, duplicate columns are of no use to anyone, and having duplicate rows could lead to overrepresentation bias, so it\u2019s worth dealing with them early on.\n\nStandardisation or Normalisation\nDepending on the dataset you\u2019re working with and the machine learning method you decide to use, it may be useful to standardize or normalize your data so that different scales of different variables don\u2019t negatively impact the performance of your model.\nThere\u2019s a lot here to go through, but honestly it wasn\u2019t as much the \u201cmemorise everything\u201d mentality that helped me insofar as it was the confidence building that learning as much as I could instilled in me. I must have failed so many interviews before the formula \u201cclicked\u201d and I realised that all of these things aren\u2019t esoteric concepts that only the elite can master, they\u2019re just tools that you use to build incredible models and derive insights from data.\n\nBest of luck on your job quest guys, if you need any help at all please let me know and I will answer emails/questions when I can.",

I'm aware this isn't particularly feasible, though.\n* No job experience, just volunteer work at humane societies years ago.\n* Didn't make any worthwhile projects on the side while in school. Currently, I'm trying to come up with projects to put on GitHub.\n* On the autism spectrum, high-functioning. I'm often prone to sensory overload, but it's improved greatly. I also don't live independently, and I rely on subsidized income.\n* Dealing with poor self-esteem and lack of confidence. Anxiety and depression can often be very overwhelming. I am medicated, though.\n* Although I worked with a great group throughout my university program, I prefer working alone. I feel like I think and work too slowly no matter how hard I try, which raises my anxiety immensely. Generally, I'm not a very social person.\n* I enjoy programming and learning about data structures. That was my favorite part. Databases never really clicked for me, but maybe that could change.\n* Proficient in Java, actively learning C++ and sometimes Python. Working on a text-based adventure game in C++. I'm also learning to develop C++ projects in Unreal.\n* I believe my greatest strength is perseverance even when things feel utterly hopeless. I'm often told that I'm logical and creative, even though I don't really see it. My grades were good, but not amazing.\n* This is slightly off-subject, but it's important to me: I've been in a long-distance relationship for several years, and we've visited many times.

She doesn't have her own place yet, either.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry if the details are excessive or too personal. I just want to paint a clear picture before I ask the following:\n\n1. Do you have any ideas for what kind of job positions I should seek? If I can avoid unpaid internships, that'd be preferable, but I understand if that's not feasible. Remote is preferred, even if the pandemic passes.\n2. What do you suggest for someone who isn't comfortable working in groups? How can I improve? Can I do something more independent?\n3. How should I go about making a portfolio? Would it be worthwhile to make my own website with some nice CSS or just stick with GitHub?\n4. After covid-related restrictions can be lifted (hopefully), I want to move to Ontario with my girlfriend. Could a tech position somehow ease the immigration process?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know this post is long, but I thank you very much for your time. Please let me know if this violates the subreddit rules in any way, sometimes I miss very obvious details. I'll try to answer any questions.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for your thoughtful feedback.

It's pretty old and outdated by now, too expensive to replace, too spaghetti to migrate...\n\n\nWell, fast-forward 4 years, I finished job training 2 years later (with an A), got hired full-time, the super nerd left the company 1.5ish years ago to study IT at uni full-time and he won't be coming back.\n\nSo basically, I'm THE IT GUY in my company now, my \"job trainer\" can assist in case of emergency, but I'm mostly managing everything alone, doing both admin and programming work.\n\nThere are multiple areas of concern for me now:\n\n* I'm pretty sure I'm horribly underpaid\n\n* All the responsibility is on my shoulders, I'm the de-facto IT lead due to being the only IT guy, but at the same time, bosses treat me like just another paper-pusher\n\n* Both bosses have little understanding for IT, don't know how much effort it takes to keep everything running while not screwing up (on the plus side, they rarely put deadlines) - they only care about results\n\n* What if the inhouse system fails? It feels like being on a sinking boat, constantly plugging holes.\n\n* I'm not getting any outside input to develop my skills. Everything is self-taught, I maintain and extend super old (e.g. PHP5) legacy code, no frameworks etc.\n\n* I feel like getting a new position \"in the industry\" will be impossible? Every job offer wants a billion different frameworks, I applied to one job that wanted exactly what I know, wasn't even invited to an interview. Disheartening. Probably because of the gappy CV (did this-n-that from 21 to 28).\n\n\nI managed to pick up the following skills by myself in the past 4 years (very loosely ordered by skill): HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, mySQL/PostgreSQL, regex, vim, Python, Windows administration, Webhosting (Apache), Exchange, VMware, Linux administration, Firewalls\n\nPlus of course I solve user problems all day.\n\nI feel like it's an okay skillset, but job offers always seem to want so much more. On the other hand, I feel lacking in other areas:\n\nWe don't have a version control system, I don't know a lot about typical CS theory questions like algorithms and data structures, as I've never needed them so far...then there's the whole teamwork aspect, I've never coded in a team since I'm alone. No \"unit tests\", QA, scrum, agile, all of this stuff.\n\nOn the plus side, I managed to \"not screw up production\" for these 4 years.\n\n\nBasically, I don't know what to do at this point. The responsibility is a bit much, the pay not adequate considering it. And there's not much to do (programming-wise) for the past year or so. I mostly browse reddit or learn more about programming. But time doesn't fly for sure, I feel a bit bored sitting around here 8h every day. At the same time, I feel like I'm getting less and less employable by other companies. Most of my worth here is company-knowledge...\n\nStarting at another company would probably offer me considerably more benefits in vacation and money - but it'll also mean losing a relatively safe job and becoming a \"replaceable little guy\". My constant flip-flopping between delusions of grandeur and impostor syndrome doesn't help matters at all :(\n\n\nAnyone can offer me some advice? Thank you.",

You can read the tl;dr at the bottom but I have a story that explains my opinion.\n\nAt the very beginning of 2019 I was faced with a choice. I could stick with a job that I enjoyed with a team of amazing engineers where I was learning a lot and meaningfully contributing to a worthwhile project.  Or I could take a job offer I received for about 50% increased total compensation with great benefits doing more boring work.  I took the new job. It wasn't that I was underpaid by my previous employer, it's just that the offer was for a contracting job in a particularly lucrative niche.\n\nAfter giving two weeks notice to my boss I made a comment in passing to the effect of \"I'm sure I won't like the new job as much but I need to do what's best for my family.\" Well he latched on to that and we had a conversation where he said \"you shouldn't just take a job for the money.\"  He said it in a way that wasn't attacking my decision but was just giving career advice and it really made me question my choice.\n\nWell about a month and a half into the new job my state announced its COVID stay-at-home order.  My wife and I did some last minute grocery shopping and as we are walking from the car to our front door we are mugged at gunpoint by two men.  They take our wallets, phones, and even my car (which was thankfully recovered but needed repairs). My wife's little sister was staying with us at the time so we made the decision to immediately relocate to a safer area.\n\nBetween replacing our phones, the mechanic bill, early lease termination, and relocating costs this was a very expensive ordeal.  We have been living paycheck-to-paycheck since then while our finances stabilize.  If I hadn't taken the higher paying job then I wouldn't have been able to move to a safer neighborhood and I would have to live knowing that my wife and our family could be looking at a gun any time we walked out the door. \n\nSo the beliefs that I now hold, and **here's the tl;dr:**\n\n* Money is *safety*\n* More money means the ability to:\n   * live in a safe area\n   * pay for medical costs (we are in the US)\n   * purchase security equipment (home security cameras, etc)\n   * respond to unforeseen expenses like car problems\n\nI will never fault a coworker or employee for switching jobs to earn more money.

If at all possible leverage connections at the places you\u2019re applying. friends, classmates, and alumni were all super helpful answering questions, or referring me to the recruiters. And ultimately just being myself and showing my passion and excitement for the field is what got me the offer. \n\nSo for those still on the grind, you\u2019ve got it, don\u2019t give up, and keep on trying! You\u2019ll get it!",

I typically take Glassdoor reviews with a grain of salt, but reading through them can give you an idea of what the company values and maybe help you just a little more on your interview prep. One thing that I found helpful for bigger companies I interviewed for was to look at the \"Interviews\" section in GlassDoor.

            "selftext": "Hi all. I work for an all remote team as a web dev doing mostly front end work. I've been at my current company for 2 years and I'm ready to search for something new in hopes of a higher salary, however I'm not sure if what I'm giving up is 'rare' or not as I've only worked for two companies so far in my career.\n\nTo be specific, the pros/cons of my job situation are:\n\nPros\n\n1. In a typical week I spend only around 28-30 hrs at my computer. The extra 10-12 hours are spent working out, eating lunch, etc\n2. Work is almost always no pressure, I often do all of the time estimation for my tickets and can decide how long I think it will take to get something done. I have never been told to work faster, or had my performance criticized\n3. It is very rare for me to have to be in any meetings other than 30 minutes of a daily standup call in which I rarely have to participate\n4. I\u2019ve never been contacted outside of work hours or asked to work over time, and I\u2019m not required to be on call\n5. When doing front end work, I make design choices almost entirely on my own\n6. I work with modern technologies\n7. I never have any issues with my coworkers or team lead. I can go to anyone for help and they will do their best to tackle whatever problem I\u2019m having with me\n8. I\u2019m never asked to do anything out of my job description\n\nCons\n\n1. I make $80k/yr, changing companies would likely make me quite a bit more than a raise ever could (but for the hours I'm *actually working,* could I even consider myself underpaid? I'm not sure)\n2. Neither the benefits nor the 401k match are very good\n3. I live in a high cost of living area due to my S/O's schooling, and won't be moving for a few years. I like to save as much as possible every month, and my salary being lower than the area's average pay doesn't do me any favors\n\n**TLDR**: I feel I have a good work/life balance that I am afraid to give up in exchange for more money, which won't even make me happier. Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? How unique is my current work situation?\n\nAlso, it might be worth noting that I am only interested in working for all remote companies\n\nThank you",

Programming in and of itself was never something I truly enjoyed, it was always more a mean to an end since I enjoy planning and seeing my creation way more than the act of typing itself. Furthermore I'm not sure anymore if I want to sit all day in front of a PC because nowadays I don't feel as comfortable sitting in front of screen all day like I used to but I would still very much like to work with my brain but in the 21 century I don't see that working outside a very computerized environment.\n\nSo I wanted to ask you know some other CS related jobs which don't require an excessive amount of time in front of a PC since I don't see myself becoming a programmer anymore and don't what I want to become anymore.\n\nAnyways, I hope y'all stay safe!",

            "selftext": "Title basically sums up this entire post. I'll quickly go over a bit of background info about me just for context: I graduated from a mid-tier (I think?) college in Summer of 2019. Immediately after graduating, I spent some time preparing for interviews and building personal projects using JavaScript and the MERN stack just to pad my resume, all while applying for jobs (albeit casually). I wasn't able to find anything until around late February 2020, when I finally received an offer from a local company. \n\nThe pay wasn't great and it didn't offer any benefits (it was a contract-to-hire role), but I was already around 7 or 8 months out from graduation so I was just glad to have finally found a job. Then the COVID lockdown hit my state and that offer got rescinded. I spent the rest of 2020 building more personal projects (again w/ JavaScript and MERN, even picked up GraphQL) frantically applying to basically any software engineer position I could find on LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed, you name it.\n\nFinally, in early December of 2020, I got a call from a recruiter who was trying to fill a position for a mid-size-ish European company. After a short conversation, I was told that they were looking for someone with experience (I spent all of 2020 hearing lines to this effect, so I basically assumed this was gonna be another rejection), but that they would try to convince the company to give me an interview anyway. In the interest of brevity I won't bore anyone with in-depth info about the process. Suffice it to say I found it pretty grueling for a company of its size and value. The process included something approximating an IQ test, and then 5 interviews (2 HR, 2 technical, then a final interview w/ some execs). \n\nLong story short, I did really well on the interviews (according to my recruiter, who I had frequent communications with). I got an offer, and like my first offer, it isn't great (though it is a bit higher than the offer I got in early 2020), but at least I wouldn't starve, and this company actually offers benefits, so I've got health insurance too. I accepted the offer and they sent me a laptop and a bunch of other equipment. I start in a few days.\n\nThere's just one problem. The company's flagship product/service (what I'd be working on) is coded in what seems to be a very obscure programming language called Smalltalk. I did some research on it during the interview process and it's ancient (1972), though I'm pretty sure it has some modern implementations (I think the company I got hired by uses a platform called Pharo or something). Smalltalk doesn't look anything like any modern mainstream language I know of, certainly nothing like JavaScript, Java or Python. The syntax is pretty alien compared to those languages. Documentation, learning materials and forums/communities for it are sparse.\n\nI'm a regular lurker on this board and I've seen lot of concerns raised about companies that use proprietary languages and such. While Smalltalk isn't proprietary to this company, it's obscure enough that I feel like it might as well be a proprietary language.\n\nWhile I'm glad to finally have a job (again... fingers crossed), I'm kind of feeling a little depressed because I feel like the experience I'll get is going to be worthless, since it's in a language that is so alien relative to more modern, mainstream ones. I know that a lot of people say that what matters most is knowledge of the fundamentals or whatever, but throughout 2020 literally every job posting I saw wanted 3+ years of experience with specific languages or tools, be it JavaScript, React, Python,  Java, Spring, C#, or whatever. I really don't want to be pidgeonholed into having to look for basically nonexistent Smalltalk positions if I lose this job or want to switch jobs for whatever other reason in the future.\n\nIs the language/framework you work with important enough to warrant trying to switch jobs as soon as I possibly can? If so, what's the shortest amount of time I can stay with this company before switching jobs without having it look bad on my resume? Will working this job for any extended period at all negatively affect my future prospects in jobs that involve mainstream, in-demand tools?\n\nThanks in advance.",

            "selftext": "TL:DR at bottom.\n\n**Background:**\n\nCall me Mister Average. I had a 2.84 GPA coming out from my B.S. in CompSci that I finished in May 2020, as well as no internships during schooling. I didn't take schooling in general very seriously, and would receive B's and C's in many of the courses. I didn't realize how important it was to have a internship until my first semester into senior year.\n\n\n\n**The Plan:**\n\nOh no! I'm out of time to get an internship! \"what ever will I do????\" is what you're asking. Well this is not the time for should've/could've mindset. We progress only forward now. There is nothing back there, look forward and keep marching.\n\nI knew it was going to be a tough journey, especially during 'Rona season so it was going to be extremely difficult for me to land anything. So I had to come up with a plan:\n\n1. Wake up early every morning and begin applying to Indeed, Glassdoor and then Linkedin.\n2. Work on personal projects\n3. Leetcode\n\n**The Process:**\n\n\nSo every single morning, I would get up and immediately take myself to the PC and begin applying. At first, I didn't know which jobs to apply to so I applied to all of them. 100 or so rejection emails later all saying \"Unfortunately we have decided to pursue other candidates at this time\", and then I got my first phone interview. It was a recruiting agency that worked with government contracting for the most part. She begin asking me questions that would be on the interview such as:\n\n1. Why do you want to work at X?\n\n2. Where do you see yourself in 5-10 years?\n\n3. What challenges have you faced?\n\n4. Describe yourself.\n\n5. Why should we hire you?\n\n6. Do you want to ask us any questions\n\n\n\nYou are probably thinking I was demolishing these questions, getting every single one perfect for how the recruiter would have wanted it right? \n\n**You're Wrong**\n\nI was stammering, nervous, mumbling, and often times throughout these questions I would just say \"I don't know.\" Did I get past the first phone interview? No, but guess what? \n\n**I just figured out some questions that would be asked in the next interview I take. The only way to truly succeed in this world is to fail.**\n\nThese questions should be **ingrained in your skull**. If you have a SO, roommate, brother, sister, mother, father, etc. to practice these questions on, then it will be better. And if you're on the boat as me, you don't so guess what? We are going to practice these questions before every single interview BY YOURSELF and say them all meticulously.\n\nB-b-but 8754378543a, which one of those questions are the most important?\n\nWell son, I would personally say that the final one is, and here is the reason I think it really helps: It shows how interested you are in the position. Should you fire 10-20 questions at them, and extend the interview by 30 minutes? \n\nNo.\n\nWhat you want to do with this is simply ask questions that if you were in the shoes of the employer, you would think to yourself \"Great Question\". Do you know how many times I have failed an interview but the dopamine hit of having the employer say \"Great Question\" when it came time for the questions to the interviewer? \n\nA lot.\n\nUnderstand what the business does, and use your questions based on that research. Also hit them with general questions such as \"What do you like about working at X?\", \"How is the WLB\", \"How has X Company been affected by 'Rona?\" as well. \n\nOn the same boat, speak about your personal projects as though they are your own children. Speak about the complexities of the problems that you faced were, **AND THEN HOW YOU SOLVED THEM**, speak about the tech stack you used, **AND WHY YOU USED THEM**, and finally give any important tidbits of information to show them how hard you worked on the application.\n\nNow finally, it's time to speak about the elephant in the room:\n\n**LEETCODE**\n\nThis sub likes to jump on the importance on leetcode, and to practice it every day. Now, don't get me wrong. It is in fact quite important to pass the coding part of the technical interview, but that is only half the battle. Remember that the questions discussed in the last section are the other half. But let's get started with the leetcode discussion. \n\nWhat to study?\n\nI would personally go with something like the blind 75:\n\nhttps://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU\n\nB-b-b-but 8754378543a, is that it? \n\nWell not only are you finishing each of these questions, but EVERY SINGLE TIME:\n\n1. You describe the code to yourself.\n\n2. Describe your thought process as you are writing it.\n\n3. What are some of the optimizations that can be made to it? \n\n4. What is the Space/Time Complexity now, and with further optimizations, what can it be taken to?\n\nAnd here is a final question before I get to the end of the post with the conclusion.\n\nWith just the blind 75 and leetcode daily you must have destroyed the technical part?\n\n**Once again, it's a resounding NO**\n\nI was once again, a stammering mess with voice cracks, chocking up, and general spaghetti coming out of my pockets. But guess what? I didn't give up, every single time I fell, I got myself back up and kept doing more and more technical interviews until I was proficient. And with 600 applications, 10 technical interviews under my belt. I finally received a SWE offer and I couldn't be more proud of myself and the journey it took to get here. More than half a year of constant fighting to get to where I am now. The me that existed months ago would be happy to know I finally got to my destination. I don't care if 1 or 2 people actually view this post, as long as I can lend a hand to those of you can't see the peak of the mountain and are discouraged ready to turn back. Allow me to lend a hand, and tell you that a mindset of moving forward, taking hits and getting back up, and you will see yourself at the top of that mountain. When you do however, I want you to lend a hand to those that can't see the peak.\n\nTL:DR: Fall, and then get up. Fail, and then succeed. Wake up, apply, work on personal projects, and leetcode. And most importantly, ask questions in your interviews.",

A couple days later, the recruiter reached out saying I got the software engineer position and received an employment offer. I haven't actually spoken with anyone on the phone, only emails. I accepted the offer (I'm pretty desperate for a job) and they said they would send me a check so that I can buy equipment to work remote. I have received the check via FedEx, but haven't deposited it. I've been suspicious from the beginning, but thought I was just being paranoid. I've only been in contact with the recruiter and he seems like a bot. I tried to call HR to verify employment, but either it disconnects or is a dead end. I asked for the recruiter's phone number and he asked what do I need and doesn't respond with a number for a while.\n\nDo I send an email to rescind my acceptance of the job offer?Not sure what to do here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thanks everyone!

I'm doing a catch-up semester now following a mobile semester and another catch-up semester before that. Which means I'd be finishing the year with about 2 years worth of european credit points..\n\nNow I think I'm pretty decent at programming, I have front-end framework experience (Angular, React and good control of the 3 basic technologies of the front-end) as well as back-end experience (NodeJS and Spring Framework) and I've passed my algorithms course and can do some decently efficient programming. I also did a mobile development semester and have made a small application as well as working on a React Native application for a real company in a team project and am definitely ready to work on something bigger. Basically I think I am hireable as a junior already, but with university I don't think I can go job seeking for a part-time job and do my university courses at the same time unless either is the sole thing I am focusing on.\n\nThe good news is I have an internship upcoming in about 3 months (or well I am supposed to find one, but my university helps with this through an internship market that they organize every semester so I am waiting for that and then I'll have one lined up hopefully). This is required as part of the degree. I think I'll be fine with this as this will absolutely give me a semester of experience that will prove my abilities afterwards for future employers together with my degree when I get it.\n\nBut I am basically constantly in this anxious state as if I am in competition with everyone else in trying to prove my abilities. I know a lot of people are better than me at software engineering and cs for sure, but I still feel like there's this constant anxiety about that I don't want new people to enter the field and that I want everyone to bluntly fuck off. I know it's completely irrational. I also constantly feel like I need to prove myself and make things that will impress people or be better than others.\n\nI have several sideprojects I am trying to do purely to satisfy that desperate feeling of being able to prove that I have the ability to be a junior developer or be hired.\n\nI'm studying things daily with the goal of building my foundation in the field so that I can be ahead of others and be more hireable than other people. But the toxic feeling of competitiveness and pressure I feel on myself to perform better than others is really driving me crazy. I feel almost manic about it and also stress over things like the field growing or random ass people being like \"I wanna be a programmer\" because I don't want more competition. I know it's entirely out of my control and a really toxic way to think but it just fucks with my head really hard and gives me stress.\n\nWhat can I do about this? Do I need therapy? Do I need to calm down? I know my worries aren't unfounded, people are getting more technologically savvy and in turn more people WILL enter cs and programming jobs.",

I landed a job after about 6 weeks with the biggest software company in my area. It was pretty hard to go from a small, start-up style company to a large corporation. The beginning was particularly hard, the tech stack at the new job was a lot different than what I was used to. It was a php backend and React JS  front end. I come from a Java background with minimal front end experience.

The php is coming pretty easily but learning React has been a challenge. A recruiter contacted me out of the blue and I eventually got an offer for a back end Java developer position with a much smaller company. This offer seems like it's better suited to my skillset and it pays more than I currently make. \n\nI've already accepted the new position but I haven't given my 2 weeks notice yet.

I haven't found any information about this scam on the internet, so I thought I'd post about it.\n\nThe job posting was for a part time software engineer position on Indeed.com.\n\nThe email correspondence was primarily with a Mr. Mark Edwards, using the email addresses torchtechnologies@engineer.com, interview.torchtechnologies@gmail.com, and torchtechnologies.careers@gmail.com. All of these are fake and not affiliated with the company as confirmed by calling the office using the number provided on the Torch Technologies website. The company has their own company email: @torchtechnologies.com.\n\nTorch Technologies is a legit company and has a very good review rating on Glassdoor. This party impersonating this company is using a sophisticated series of canned responses and pre-designed forms that seem almost legitimate. \n\nBut there are a few obvious red flags, which together combined to make me suspicious enough to learn the truth. These included, but we're not limited to: bountiful spelling and grammatical errors; mismatches in font and size / styling in the correspondence; unprofessional communication; lack of signatures or contact information given; inability to answer basic questions about the company and its goals; a rushed hiring process involving only an online email based interview, with no phone calls or face time -- nor any technical questions; they hired me on the spot; a \"too good to be true\" \"salary\" of $60/hr plus benefits for an entry level position; they rushed me to make a decision on the job offer, giving me a deadline of until the end of the business day; poor formatting of copied/pasted info; unprofessional scheduling of the interview (they said to basically just contact them when I'm available within the next 2 days); declining to provide any way to contact the development team until \"after training\" (possibly the hugest red flag).\n\nFinally, after declining the offer on the grounds that I would not accept any offer in which I could not first speak to the dev team, I have yet to hear back from this Mr. Mark Edwards, nor his \"HR department\" with whom I was also in contact. My guess is that this wing of the operation is run by one person, who controls all the email accounts and has the same sloppy writing style.\n\nBut despite all of these red flags, I still say this scam was sophisticated. They went to a huge amount of effort to make this ruse. They have a lot of legit-sounding information, but they fail to glue it all together. Still I have to give them credit.\n\nAnyways, I just wanted to bring this to the attention of you all, in hopes that it just might save some poor soul from getting their bank account robbed clean. I honestly might have fallen for this scam because I just wanted to believe it was true.\n\nI thought, why would they pray on college students who are in debt (read: not wealthy) and educated enough to notice a scam when it pops up? I don't know, but obviously it works or they wouldn't do it.\n\nApologies for any grammatical / spelling errors as I'm on mobile. Apologies too if this isn't the right place to post this. If not, please direct me to a better place to get this information out. Thanks for reading.",

I took my first CS class later that year and fell in love with it, and decided I wanted to pursue software engineering.\n\nI had a lot of cards stacked against me, I was a recently homeless woman of color in a low-income, single-parent household, and it was too late for me to pursue a CS degree. I decided to take as many CS classes as possible and decided to teach myself everything else along the way. I knew my tech skills weren't the strongest, but I had professional work experience and always excelled at soft-skills. I was able to find a tech-adjacent job and that job helped me land more formal CS experience. I took a lot of advice from this subreddit; I went to hackathons, did Leetcode, and contributed to open-source projects. Unfortunately I ended up graduating into a COVID recession, but after 3 months of applying aggressively (close to 800 applications), screwing up technical interviews, etc. I finally landed \\*one\\* full-time software engineering job offer. It's not FAANG or a tech company for that matter, and the location is not ideal, but the salary is great and I know it will open a lot of doors for me.\n\nI wanted to share my experience to show that you can succeed in this field with an unconventional background. Tech skills are important but your soft skills are indispensable - I'm certain that my soft skills are what helped me land this job. I'm happy to answer any questions or hear from other people with a similar background/experience.\n\nEdit: Wow thank you for all the awards and positive comments! I noticed there is some confusion about my timeline in the comments, so I wanted to clarify that I ended up taking another year of college to take as many CS classes as possible.

            "selftext": "This is in Louisiana for a DBA role. I got an offer for $86k, but was told twice before and after the interview that the range was $91k - $95k. The job listed only 3-5 years experience, but I have 6+ years experience. They said the reason they had to pay lower was because I didn't have a bachelors in CS so they had to waive it. The degree wasn't mandatory as the job description said Bachelors or revelant experience. I have all the skills and also have the experience in the same industry as the company. Im also a US citizen if that matters.\n\nBefore I made a counter, I asked the HR guy if there was a possibility of the offer being rescinded and he said 100 percent they will not do that and at most they would  decline the counter. When I got the offer, I asked if I could take 1 day to think it over and he said he can submit a counter offer if I wanted so I did. I was very polite and also apologetic to the HR guy because I felt bad he had to do extra work. \n\nShould I be worried of it getting rescinded? I believe I'm their first pick but I'm worried right now that they are trying to get someone else with a degree and have me on the back burner. I did notice they removed their job listen for there role. It has been 2 days since I made the counter.\n\n What are your thoughts?\n\nEDIT: Sorry, I forgot to mentioned I countered to have the salary increased to $95k, which is still a bit lower than market rate and lower than what I had previously made in my past jobs.\n\nEDIT 2: Not sure if this matters, but normally a candidate had to go to a 3rd round to meet with the CTO, but the hiring managers I guess liked me enough to have me bypass the 3rd round.",

A job has opened up, the same exact position as mine for another city which is much closer to where we want to live. It also would be about a 5-6% increase in pay.
